# Section 22

Some of the ASCII codes without visible characters have been given symbolic names in this program because they are used with a special meaning.

```c include/constants.h
#define NULL_CODE       0   // ASCII code that might disappear
#define CARRIAGE_RETURN 13  // ASCII code used at end of line
#define INVALID_CODE    127 // ASCII code that many systems prohibit in text files
```
