# Section 589

Sometimes it is desirable to make horizontal or vertical rules line up precisely with certain features in characters of a font.
It is possible to guarantee the correct matching between `DVI` output and the characters generated by `METAFONT` by adhering to the following principles:
(1)&nbsp;The `METAFONT` characters should be positioned so that a bottom edge or left edge that is supposed to line up with the bottom or left edge of a rule appears at the reference point, i.e., in row&nbsp;0 and column&nbsp;0 of the `METAFONT` raster.
This ensures that the position of the rule will not be rounded differently when the pixel size is not a perfect multiple of the units of measurement in the `DVI` file.
(2)&nbsp;A typeset rule of height $a>0$ and width *b* > 0 should be equivalent to a `METAFONT`-generated character having black pixels in precisely those raster positions whose `METAFONT` coordinates satisfy $0 \leq x < \alpha b$ and $0 \leq y < \alpha a$, where $\alpha$ is the number of pixels per `DVI` unit.
