# Section 560

$\TeX$ checks the information of a `TFM` file for validity as the file is being read in, so that no further checks will be needed when typesetting is going on.
The somewhat tedious subroutine that does this is called *read_font_info*.
It has four parameters: the user font identifier&nbsp;*u*, the file name and area strings *nom* and *aire*, and the "at" size&nbsp;*s*.
If *s*&nbsp;is negative, it's the negative of a scale factor to be applied to the design size; *s = âˆ’1000* is the normal case.
Otherwise *s* will be substituted for the design size; in this case, *s* must be positive and less than 2048&nbsp;pt (i.e., it must be less than $2^{27}$ when considered as an integer).

The subroutine opens and closes a global file variable called *tfm_file*.
It returns the value of the internal font number that was just loaded.
If an error is detected, an error message is issued and no font information is stored; *NULL_FONT* is returned in this case.

```c include/font_metric.h
#define abort goto bad_tfm // do this when the `TFM` data is wrong
```

```c font_metric.c
// << Start file |font_metric.c| >>

// input a `TFM` file
internal_font_number read_font_info(pointer u, str_number nom, str_number aire, scaled s) {
    font_index k; // index into |font_info|
    bool file_opened; // was |tfm_file| successfully opened?
    halfword lf, lh, bc, ec, nw, nh, nd, ni, nl, nk, ne, np; // sizes of subfiles
    internal_font_number f; // the new font's number
    internal_font_number g; // the number to return
    eight_bits a, b, c, d; // byte variables
    memory_word qw;
    scaled sw; // accumulators
    int bch_label; // left boundary start location, or infinity
    int bchar; // boundary character, or 256
    scaled z; // the design size or the ``at'' size
    int alpha, beta; // auxiliary quantities used in fixed-point multiplication
    int temp; // temporary data for read_sixteen macro
    g = NULL_FONT;
    // << Read and check the font data; |abort| if the TFM file is malformed; if there's no room for this font, say so and |goto done|; otherwise |incr(font_ptr)| and |goto done| >>
bad_tfm:
    // << Report that the font won't be loaded >>
done:
    if (file_opened) {
        b_close(tfm_file);
    }
    return g;
}
```
