# Section 110: Packed data

In order to make efficient use of storage space, $\TeX$ bases its major data structures on a *memory_word*, which contains either a (signed) integer, possibly scaled, or a (signed) *glue_ratio*, or a small number of fields that are one half or one quarter of the size used for storing integers.

If *x* is a variable of type *memory_word*, it contains up to four fields that can be referred to as follows:

|                                                  |                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------|
*x.int*                                            | (an *integer*)<br>                           |
*x.sc*                                             | (a *scaled* integer)<br>                     |
*x.gr*                                             | (a *glue_ratio*)<br>                         |
*x.hh.lh*, *x.hh.rh*                               | (two halfword fields)<br>                    |
*x.hh.b0*, *x.hh.b1*, *x.hh.rh*                    | (two quarterword fields, one halfword field) |
*x.qqqq.b0*, *x.qqqq.b1*, *x.qqqq.b2*, *x.qqqq.b3* | (four quarterword fields)                    |

This is somewhat cumbersome to write, and not very readable either, but macros will be used to make the notation shorter and more transparent.
The Pascal code below gives a formal definition of *memory_word* and its subsidiary types, using packed variant records.
$\TeX$ makes no assumptions about the relative positions of the fields within a word.

Since we are assuming 32-bit integers, a halfword must contain at least 16 bits, and a quarterword must contain at least 8 bits.
But it doesn't hurt to have more bits; for example, with enough 36-bit words you might be able to have *MEM_MAX* as large as 262142, which is eight times as much memory as anybody had during the first four years of $\TeX$'s existence.

N.B.: Valuable memory space will be dreadfully wasted unless $\TeX$ is compiled by a Pascal that packs all of the *memory_word* variants into the space of a single integer.
This means, for example, that *glue_ratio* words should be *short_real* instead of *double* on some computers.
Some Pascal compilers will pack an integer whose subrange is *'0 .. 255'* into an eight-bit field, but others insist on allocating space for an additional sign bit;
on such systems you can get 256 values into a quarterword only if the subrange is *'âˆ’128 .. 127'*.

The present implementation tries to accommodate as many variations as possible, so it makes few assumptions.
If integers having the subrange *'MIN_QUARTERWORD .. MAX_QUARTERWORD'* can be packed into a quarterword, and if integers having the subrange *'MIN_HALFWORD .. MAX_HALFWORD'* can be packed into a halfword, everything should work satisfactorily.

It is usually most efficient to have *MIN_QUARTERWORD = MIN_HALFWORD = 0*, so one should try to achieve this unless it causes a severe problem.
The values defined here are recommended for most 32-bit computers.

> ![NOTE]
> This implementation is made for 64-bit integers so *quarterword* is 16 bits, *halfword* is 32 bits.
> Also, *MIN_HALFWORD* is negative so it fits nicely with *int* type.
> 
> A *memory_word* is defined as a *union* to make it hold different type from the same memory region.

```c include/constants.h
#define MIN_QUARTERWORD 0           // smallest allowable value in a |quarterword|
#define MAX_QUARTERWORD 65535       // largest allowable value in a |quarterword|
#define MIN_HALFWORD    -0x3fffffff // smallest allowable value in a |halfword|
#define MAX_HALFWORD    0x3fffffff  // largest allowable value in a |halfword|
```
