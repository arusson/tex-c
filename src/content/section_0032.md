# Section 32

The user's terminal acts essentially like other files of text, except that it is used both for input and for output.
When the terminal is considered an input file, the file variable is called *term_in*, and when it is considered an output file the file variable is *term_out*.

> ![NOTE]
> Terminal is not manipulated with *alpha_file*.
