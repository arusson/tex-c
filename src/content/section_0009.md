# Section 9

If the first character of a Pascal comment is a dollar sign, Pascal-H treats the comment as a list of "compiler directives" that will affect the translation of this program into machine language.
The directives shown below specify full checking and inclusion of the Pascal debugger when $\TeX$ is being debugged, but they cause range checking and other redundant code to be eliminated when the production system is being generated.
Arithmetic overflow will be detected in all cases.

> ![NOTE]
> No ⟨ Compiler directives 9 ⟩.
